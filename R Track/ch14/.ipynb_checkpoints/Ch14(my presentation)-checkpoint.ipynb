Therefore, instead of representing the value of the nominal predictor by a single scalar value x, we will represent the nominal predictor by a vector $\\vec{x}$ = $<x_1, ..., x_j >$, where $J$ is the number of categories that the predictor has.

    "rate denoted by λ. The probability of any particular observed rate, given an underlying\n",
    "rate of λ, is modeled by a Poisson distribution, which is denoted as freq ∼ dpois(λ). The\n",
    "Poisson distribution was smuggled into the text back in Exercise 11.3, p. 235, which I’m\n",
    "sure is still as fresh in your memory as a beached fish. Don’t worry, the Poisson will be\n",
    "explained again later (Section 22.1.3). The Poisson distribution specifies a probability for\n",
    "each possible observed rate. The Poisson puts highest probabilities on rates near λ.\n",
    "Our goal is to estimate the underlying rates at which each nominal combination is produced. But more than that, we would like to know if the attributes occur independently of\n",
    "each other, or instead covary in some way. For example, if political and religious affiliation\n",
    "are independent, then there should be the same proportion of Unitarians among Democrats\n",
    "as among Republicans. Mathematically, independence means p(Unitarian&Democrat) =\n",
    "p(Unitarian) × p(Democrat) and p(Unitarian&Republican) = p(Unitarian) × p(Republican)\n",
    "and so on for every combination of attribute values. To shorten the expressions, I’ll substi tute U for Unitarian and D for Democrat, whereby independence means\n",
    "p(U&D) = p(U) × p(D)\n",
    "and so on for every combination of attributes. That expression for probabilities corresponds\n",
    "to the following expression in terms of frequencies:\n",
    "freq(U&D)/N = freq(U)/N × freq(D)/N\n",
    "which can be re-arranged as\n",
    "freq(U&D) = freq(U) × freq(D) × 1/N.\n",
    "Notice that independence is expressed as a multiplicative product of attribute influences.\n",
    "But all the models we’ve considered in this chapter used an additive sum of predictor influences. To be able to use our familiar additive models, we’ll transform the frequencies by a\n",
    "logarithm, because the logarithm of the product of values equals the sum of the logarithms\n",
    "of the values. In other words,\n",
    "log(freq(U&D)) = log(freq(U)) + log(freq(D)) + log(1/N).\n",
    "The notation “log(freq(value))” gets cumbersome, so we’ll substitute the notation βv. Thus,\n",
    "log(freq(U&D)) = βU + βD + β0,\n",
    "where β0 stands in for the constant log(1/N). Finally, it’s unintuitive to talk about the\n",
    "logarithms of frequencies, so we’ll exponentiate to get rid of the leading logarithm, yielding:\n",
    "freq(U&D) = exp (βU + βD + β0) .\n",
    "To summarize, if independence is true, then the expression above should be true, for every\n",
    "combination of attribute values.\n",
    "But of course the attributes are usually not independent, and we would like some measure of lack of independence. We already have such a measure in the context of linear\n",
    "models, namely, the interaction term. Thus, we will include an interaction term that estimates deviation from independence. Thus, our model ends up being as follows. For two\n",
    "nominal attributes, we put the observed frequencies in a table, with one attribute’s values\n",
    "listed down the rows, and the other attribute’s values listed across the columns. The frequency in the rth row and cth column is denoted freqrc, and the underlying rate for that cell\n",
    "is denoted λ\n",
    "rc. The model looks like this:\n",
    "λ\n",
    "rc = exp (β0 + βr + βc + βr ×c)\n",
    "freqrc ∼ dpois(λrc) (14.16)\n",
    "with the usual constraints (from Equation 14.10)\n",
    "Xr\n",
    "βr = 0 and X\n",
    "c\n",
    "βc = 0 and X\n",
    "r\n",
    "βr ×c,r,c = 0 ∀c and X\n",
    "c\n",
    "βr×c,r,c = 0 ∀r\n",
    "The point of this over-fast prelude to contingency table analysis is merely to demonstrate that the core of the model we’ll be using is the same as the linear model that was\n",
    "mentioned for multifactor ANOVA in Table 14.1. Thus, all the applied analyses we’ll see\n",
    "in the remainder of the book are based on the GLM."
