    "  In null hypothesis significance testing(NHST), the goal of inference is to decide whether a particular value of a model parameter can be rejected. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  For example, we might want to know whether a coin is fair, which in NHST becomes the question of whether we can reject the hypothesis that the bias of the coin has the specific value 0.5.\n",
    "  To make the logic of NHST concrete, suppose we have a coin that we want to test for fairness. We decide that we will conduct an experiment wherein we flip the coin N = 26 times, and we observe how many times it comes up heads. If the coin is fair, it should usually come up heads about 13 times out of 26 flips. Only rarely will it come up with far\n",
    "fewer or far greater than 13 heads. \n",
    "  Suppose we now conduct our experiment: We flip the coin N = 26 times and we happen to observe z = 8 heads. All we need to do is figure out the probability of getting that few heads if the coin were truly fair. If the probability of getting so few heads is sufficiently tiny, then we doubt that the coin is truly fair.\n",
    "Notice that this reasoning depends on the notion of repeating the intended experiment, because we are computing the probability of getting 8 heads if we were to repeat an experiment with N = 26. In other words, we are figuring out the probability of getting 8 heads relative to the space of all possible outcomes when N = 26. Why do we restrict consideration to N = 26? Because that was the intention of the experimenter.\n",

    "  The problem with NHST is that the interpretation of the observed outcome depends on the space of possible outcomes when the experiment is repeated. Why is that a problem? Because the definition of the space of possible outcomes depends on the intentions of the experimenter. \n",
    "   ## Intention!!!\n",
    "   If the experimenter intended to flip the coin exactly N = 26 times, then the space of possibilities is all samples with N = 26. But if the experimenter intended to flip the coin for one minute (and merely happened to make 26 flips during that time) then the space of possibilities is all samples that could occur when flipping the coin for one minute. Some of those possibilities would have N = 26, but some would have N = 23, and some would have N = 32, etc. On the other hand, the experimenter might have intended to flip the coin until observing 8 heads, and it just happened to take 26 flips to get there. In this case, the space of possibilities is all samples that have the 8th head as the last flip. Notice that for any of those intended experiments (fixed N, fixed time, or fixed z), the actually-observed data are the same: z = 8 and N = 26. But the probability of the observed\n",
    "data is different relative to each experiment space. The space of possibilities is determined by what the experimenter had in mind while flipping the coin.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Do the observed data depend on what the experimenter had in mind? \n",
    "  ### We certainly hope not! \n",
    "  A good experiment is founded on the principle that the data are insulated from experimenter’s intentions. The coin “knows” only that it was flipped 26 times, regardless of what the experimenter had in mind while doing the flipping. Therefore our conclusion about the coin should not depend on what the experimenter had in mind while flipping it. This chapter explains some of the gory details of NHST, to bring mathematical rigor to the above comments, and to bring rigor mortis to NHST. You’ll see how NHST is committed to the notion that the covert intentions of the experimenter are crucial to interpreting the\n",

    "Now for some of the mathematical details of NHST. Suppose we intend to flip a coin N = 26 times and we happen to observe z = 8 heads. This result seems to suggest that the coin is biased, because the result is less than the 13 heads that we would expect to get from a fair coin. But someone who is skeptical about the claim that the coin is biased, i.e., a defender of the null hypothesis that the coin is fair, would argue that the seemingly biased result could have happened merely by chance from a genuinely fair coin. Because a “false alarm”(제 1종 오류), i.e., rejection of a null hypothesis when it is really true, is considered to be very costly in scientific practice, we decide that we will only reject the null hypothesis if the probability that it could generate the result is very small, conventionally less than 5%. In other words, to reject the null hypothesis, we need to show that the probability of getting something as extreme as z = 8, when N = 26, is less than 5%.(유의수준)"

    "samples by chance alone. This means that we get a false alarm on a proportion αPC of\n",
    "replications of a comparison test. Therefore, we do not get a false alarm on the complementary\n",

    "the probability of not getting a false alarm on any of the tests is (1 − αPC)c. Consequently,\n",
    "the probability of getting at least one false alarm is 1 − (1 − αPC)c. We call that probability\n",
    "of getting at least one false alarm, across all the comparisons in the experiment, the “experimentwise”\n",
    "false alarm rate, denoted αEW. Here’s the rub: αEW is greater than αPC. For\n",
    "example, if αPC = .05 and c = 6, then αEW = 1 − (1 − αPC)c = .26. Thus, even when the\n",

    "six independent comparisons, we have a 26% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis for at\n",
    "least one of the comparisons. Usually not all comparisons are structurally independent of\n",
    "each other, so the false alarm rate does not increase so rapidly, but it does increase whenever\n",
    "additional comparison tests are conducted.\n",
    "One way to keep the experimentwise false alarm rate down to 5% is by reducing the permitted\n",
