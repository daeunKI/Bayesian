    "examples of metric, ordinal, and nominal scales, respectively (Stevens, 1946).\n",
    "Examples ofmetric scales include response time (i.e., latency or duration), temperature,\n",
    "height, and weight. Those are actually cases of a specific type of metric scale, called a ratio\n",
    "scale, because they have a natural zero point on the scale. The zero point on the scale\n",
    "corresponds to there being a complete absence of the stuff being measured. For example,\n",
    "when the duration is zero, there has been no time elapsed, and when the weight is zero,\n",
    "there is no downward force. Because these scales have a natural zero point, it is meaningful\n",
    "to talk about ratios of amounts being measured, and that is why they are called ratio scales.\n",

    "about them is the amount of stuff in an interval on the scale, not the amount of stuff at a\n",
    "point on the scale. Despite the conceptual difference between ratio and interval scales, we\n",
    "will lump them together into the category of metric scales.\n",
    "A special case of metric-scaled data is count data, also called frequency data. For example, the number of cars that pass through an intersection during an hour is a count. The\n",

    "When we are told that, in a race, Jane came in first, Jill came in second, and Jasmine came\n",
    "in third, we only know the order. We do not know whether Jane beat Jill by a nose or by a\n",

    "because we cannot say the difference between ratings of 5 and 4 is the same amount of\n",
    "difference as between ratings of 4 and 3.\n",
    "Examples of nominal, a.k.a. categorical, scales include political party affiliation, the\n",
    "face of a rolled die, and the result of a flipped coin. For nominal scales, there is neither\n",
    "distance between categories nor order between categories. For example, suppose we measure the political party affiliation of a person. The categories of the scale might be Green,\n",
    "Democrat, Republican, Libertarian, and Other. While some political theories might infer\n",
    "that the parties fall on some underlying liberal-conservative scale, there is no such scale\n",
    "in the actual categorical values themselves. In the actual categorical labels there is neither\n",
    "distance nor ordering.\n",
    "In summary, if two items have different nominal values, all we know is that the two\n",

    "different ordinal values, we know that the two items are different and we know which one is\n",
